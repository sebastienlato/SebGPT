## Current phase

Phase 1 — Dataset

## Current milestone

Acquisition checkpoint approved; precise extraction-contract discussion in progress.

## Completed work

- SebGPT project concept agreed.
- Learning-first approach agreed.
- Python and PyTorch direction agreed.
- Work will be used for primary project collaboration.
- Codex will be used as an engineering assistant.
- Repository files will be the authoritative source of truth.
- Initial continuity documents and project directories created.
- Phase 0.1 continuity infrastructure reviewed and approved.
- Mac environment audited: macOS 26.6.2, Apple M4 Max (`arm64`), Python.org CPython 3.14.4, pip 26.0.1, and Git 2.54.0.
- Project-local `.venv` created and excluded from Git.
- Stable PyTorch 2.14.0 installed from its native macOS ARM64 wheel.
- Direct and fully resolved dependency manifests created.
- CPU tensor operations, autograd, MPS availability, and an MPS tensor operation verified.
- Environment test suite added and verified with all three tests passing on the host Mac.
- Git repository initialized on `main` with a clean Phase 0 baseline commit.
- Phase 1 explicitly authorized.
- Dataset suitability, scope, provenance, and leakage tradeoffs discussed.
- Project Gutenberg eBook #100 selected as the sole source for an approximately 170,000-word eight-play corpus.
- Whole-work manifest approved: six training plays, *The Tempest* for validation, and *Twelfth Night* for test.
- Training-only Unicode character inventory and non-mutating validation/test unseen-character audit approved without selecting a tokenizer.
- Dataset specification and gated acquisition contract documented in `docs/DATASET_SPEC.md`.
- Exact raw-source Git preservation exception and authoritative tracked manifest contract documented.
- Corrected dataset specification and acquisition contract reviewed and approved.
- Dataset-design specification committed as `a3821da6331c8e885f6935c442e896105c9a9340`.
- The catalog-linked Project Gutenberg eBook #100 UTF-8 artifact acquired once to the approved raw path without transformation.
- Raw source verified at 5,638,480 bytes with SHA-256 `3cf4b3d44ee14cff4e14e78e2ad3318eff76f3f7f2afc3cee6bb925879110a37`.
- Strict UTF-8 decoding passed; no BOM or NUL bytes were found; all 196,398 observed line endings are CRLF.
- Source provenance and response metadata recorded in the authoritative tracked JSON manifest.
- Read-only wrapper, global contents, selected-work marker, and formatting inspection recorded without exposing *Twelfth Night* prose.
- Raw-source acquisition and provenance milestone reviewed and approved for its dedicated checkpoint.

## Current work

Discussing deterministic extraction rules without implementing them.

## Current model status

None. No model code exists.

## Last verified working state

The raw master at `data/raw/gutenberg-ebook-100/complete-works.txt` matches the recorded SHA-256, decodes strictly as UTF-8, and is preserved in the acquisition checkpoint with its provenance records. No extraction, preprocessing, character inventory, tokenization, dataset loader, or model implementation exists.

## Next exact step

Sebastien reviews and approves or amends the proposed deterministic extraction contract before any extractor or processed dataset is created.

## Known issues

- PyTorch emits a warning that optional NumPy interoperability is unavailable. NumPy is intentionally not installed because no current milestone requires it.
- MPS is unavailable inside some restricted execution contexts, but direct host verification and the unrestricted test suite both pass.
- The catalog reports a 2025-08-24 update date, while the artifact response reports `Last-Modified: Tue, 01 Sep 2026 07:55:49 GMT`; both are recorded without assuming they describe the same revision mechanism.
- Candidate selected-work markers are known, but exact extraction inclusions/exclusions and processed corpus sizes remain intentionally undecided.
- Validation/test-only Unicode code points are intentionally unresolved until the required audit is run and Phase 2 chooses a generic unseen-input policy.

## Important constraints

- Do not implement extraction or create processed data until Sebastien approves the extraction contract.
- Do not add dependencies without an approved, recorded reason and lock-file update.
- Do not extract, normalize, split, or tokenize text during the acquisition milestone.
- Derive the Phase 1 Unicode character inventory from training data only; do not define a token vocabulary in Phase 1.
- Audit and report validation/test-only Unicode code points under the sealed-test diagnostic contract without discarding, replacing, normalizing, or adding them.
- Do not implement tokenization, neural networks, Transformers, training, or inference yet.
- Do not use a pretrained language model or external model API as the model implementation.
- Do not skip educational phases or silently change the model architecture.
- Preserve reproducibility and keep core machine-learning code understandable.

## Open questions

- Which precise extraction contract does Sebastien approve after the design discussion?

## Session handoff

The dataset-design and raw-source acquisition checkpoints are complete. Continue with extraction-contract discussion only. Do not implement extraction or create processed data until Sebastien explicitly approves the resulting contract.
